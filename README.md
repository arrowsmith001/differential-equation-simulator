# Differential Equations Simulator

Graphical tool for simulating and visualizing systems of differential equations. [_Try it out here!_](https://arrowsmith001.github.io/differential-equation-simulator/)

No programming is required - just type in the system of equations, set some initial conditions, and press play!

Pre-loaded with the [Lorenz System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) of ODEs, though I hope to expand this to include many different presets.
